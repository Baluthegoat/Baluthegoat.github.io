### Topic : Database Users and Database Administrators
---

During flip class we discussed the differences between database users and database administrators. A database user is someone who;
Provide the security to the database and allows only the authorized users to access the database. User who don't have the knowledge of DBS but use the database in their daily work. Moreover it's user who have the knowledge of DBS and who can develop their own database application using SQL.

A database administrator is someone who;
Manage the relationship between database vendors and service providers. In other words we can say that they act like a nagotiator. They act like a auditors for the database system checking if the database is working properly or not. They even act as a troubleshooters, providing techinical support to the users. They also create rules and regulations for the database user. They are also responsible for designing the blue print for the database. Finally they make sure that the database is running as efficiently as possible.

During flip class we discuss about Database administrator within our own group for 20 minutes. After that i explained about the database administrator to the other group peers.

To improve the flip class we need to do some practical work to have better understanding on how things actually works. Because I believe some understand more better on doing the practical works.
