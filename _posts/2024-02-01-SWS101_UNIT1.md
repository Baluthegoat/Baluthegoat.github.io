## Before knowing about networking.
Before knowing about networking, I had a basic understanding of the Internet that it's just a radio signal transmitting from the device to satellite and bouncing back to it. More over I thought that WIFI and hotspot it's a local network that acts like a internet. on top of that the surprising thing was sharing hotsport from mobile to computer/laptop because I didn't even thought that we could use internet on laptop from phone.

Not only but also the confusing part is that when we use hostport from phone, like I have mentioned above phone acts like a satellite. What ever the computer is requesting it gets using the internet from the phone.

**Level 0** In level 0 I have log into the game server using ssh(secure shell protocol) on port 2220 and password is bandit0. In level0 the password for next level is stored in file called **readme**. I used **ls** to see the file and used **cat** command to see the content of the file. So I got the password for the next level.
