### Topic : Entity Relationship Diagram for proposed sysytem.
---
During flip class I learned about the ER diagram and how to create it using a proposed system. The topics was quite interesting as we were asked to draw the ER diagram and the topics were group 1(online health book), group 2(airline ticketing), group 3(mobile banking application), group 4(student information management system), group 5(bus booking), group 6(voter registration).On top of that I also learned about the mapping cardinalities(one, many, one and only one, zero or one, one or many, zero or many) and also learned about mandatory for both entities, mandatory for one entity,optional for the other, optional for one entity, mandatory for the other and optional for both entities. Moreover I also learned about weak entity and strong entity. So weak entity depend on strong entity to ensure the existence of weak entity.

During flip class I was allocated in group 5 with other peers and we were tasked to create a entity relationship diagram on bus booking. So during discussion we discuss about the bus booking on online platform and physically going to bus station for ticketing. After the discussion I was the person to present entity relationship diagram about the bus booking.

As compared to first flip class this week we had more interactive discussion. So for next class I would like to have same class.
