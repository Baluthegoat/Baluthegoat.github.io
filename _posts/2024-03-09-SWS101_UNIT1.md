## Before knowing about networking.
Before knowing about networking, I had a basic understanding of the Internet that it's just a radio signal transmitting from the device to satellite and bouncing back to it. More over I thought that WIFI and hotspot it's a local network that acts like a internet. on top of that the surprising thing was sharing hotsport from mobile to computer/laptop because I didn't even thought that we could use internet on laptop from phone.

Not only but also the confusing part is that when we use hostport from phone, like I have mentioned above phone acts like a satellite. What ever the computer is requesting it gets using the internet from the phone.

**How does the internet work?**
The web broswer connects to the web server and send a http request for the web page. When the web server recevices the requested page. It check for the requested page and sends back the page. If the desired page is not found then the web server will send the http 404 error which means that the page is not found in the server.

**How does computer network work?**
Computer uses a system of rules called communication protocols to transmit information over physical or wireless technology.

**Level 0.** In level 0 I have log into the game server using ssh(secure shell protocol) on port 2220 and password is bandit0. In level0 the password for next level is stored in file called **readme**. I used **ls** to see the file and used **cat** command to see the content of the file. So I got the password for the next level.

**Level 1** I used the **ls** to see what files are there in the directory. There I found a file called **-** in the home directory and used **cat < -** to see the content of the file.

**Level 2** the file in this level is stored in the file named spaces in the filename in home directory. So I used **cat "spaces in the filename"** and found the password.

**Level 3** the file in this level is hidden in **inhere directory**. I changed the file directory to inhere and **ls** to see the files. So I used **cat .hidden** command to see the hidden file.

**Level 4** the file is present in the **inhere directory** and it's human readable. I changed to **inhere directory** and saw many files. There was a **-file07 ACSII text** thats human readable. So **cat ./-file07** and got the password.

**Level 5** the file is present in the **inhere directory** that's human-readable, 1033bytes in size and not executable. changed the directory to inhere, ls the file and used the **find -size 1033c ! -executable** and **cat ./maybehere07/.file2**.

**Level 6** the file is present in the server and some properties of the file was given username, user group and the size of the file. i use the **find ./ -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c**. It showed me the list of files. But the file **./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password** was the file I wanted. So **cat ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password**.

**Level 7** the file is present next to the word millionth. I used **grep millionth data.txt**(grep command is used to search for lines matching the specific pattern) and the result was showed.

**Level 8** the file is present in a unique way so I used **ls** to list the files and sorted the files as specified **sort data.txt |uniq -u**.

**Level 9** the file is present in a data.txt and it's human readable strings. I **ls** the file list and found **data.txt**. I **sort data.txt| uniq -u**, it listed many files. So I used **cat data.txt|string|grep ^=**.

**Level 10** the file is present as base64 encoded data. I **ls** the file and found data.txt. So I used **cat data.txt|base64 --decoded** and found the answer.
